## Homework 2

### Exercise 2: Dynamic List Rendering with Props

The following array of objects is given below:

```js
const tasks = [
  { name: "Learn React", priority: "High" },
  { name: "Do Groceries", priority: "Low" },
  { name: "Exercise", priority: "High" },
  { name: "Read a Book", priority: "Medium" },
]
```

Create a new `ListItem` component that will accept props `items' and will display the items from above in an unordered list. Also make a component for each item and use some basic CSS styling.
